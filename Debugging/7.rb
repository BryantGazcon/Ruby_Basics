=begin
original code was the same only difference was line 32 which was 
balance = calculate_balance(month) this was incorrect because for each month 
it would update balance with that value instead of adding all month balance values.
To fix this all we had to do as include an assignment operator += which would
add the month balance and then assign it to variable balance. 
balance =  balance + calculate_balance(month)
